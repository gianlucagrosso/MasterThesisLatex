\note{Patching}{Main reference \cite{Hiroshi2023}; \textit{reset mode} of TCI eliminates bad pivots that occur when the algorithm first explores regions where $\mathcal{T}$ is small and only later configurations that are larger $\to$ this could be sufficient but not enough hence patching; patched TCI benefints from \textit{global pivot updates} coming from previous TCI decompositions; patching helps solving ergodicity problems; }\\
